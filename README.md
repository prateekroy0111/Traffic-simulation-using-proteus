# Traffic-simulation-using-proteus

Requirements : Proteus + Arduino IDE

Description
***********
This project is Arduino uno based 4-way traffic simulation with fixed delay for changing the LED from red to yellow to green. The large shopping or commercial mall which has such 4-way parking arrangement can make use of it in order to conduct smooth conduction of parking arrangements. Once improved substantially it can used in road transport of small highways such as state highway.
